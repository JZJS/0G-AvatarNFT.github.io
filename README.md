## Introduction

**0G-AvatarNFT** is an innovative project built on top of **0G’s Intelligent NFTs (INFTs)** technology.  
It enables you to store your NFT **and** its associated AI Agent metadata together, bringing NFTs to life with privacy, ownership, and tradability.

## Features

## Why 0G-AvatarNFT?

Traditional AI Agents often:
- Lack privacy and store user data on centralized servers.
- Cannot be truly owned or transferred by the user.

**0G-AvatarNFT** solves these issues by:
- Combining decentralized **storage** and **compute** for secure AI operations.
- Giving you total control over your AI Agent’s data and personality.
- Making AI Agents tradable as NFTs.
